 * \section sec-ex-manual-1 Generate an acyclic random graph
 * This example shows how to generate a random graph, make it acyclic by removing edges, and then store it as a GML file.
 *
 * \include gen-acyclic-graph.cpp
 *
 * <h3>Step-by-step explanation</h3>
 *
 *   -# We first have to include all header files declaring the classes and functions we want to use. OGDF's header files
 *      are contained in subdirectories of a common include directory <tt>ogdf</tt>. Here we use the class ogdf::Graph,
 *      a graph generator function ogdf::randomSimpleGraph(), an algorithm for making a digraph acyclic (ogdf::DfsAcyclicSubgraph),
 *      and functionality for exporting graphs provided by ogdf::GraphIO.
