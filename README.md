# OGDF.js

these project is in active developing. My idea is to compile ogdf library into javascipts using [emscripten](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten).

Now the library is complied to javascript file named GraphLayout.js(WASM based) successfully. The more details will be updated later.

You can see the performance in indexSquare.html and indexLoad.html(need a server, you can use `python -m http.server`)
